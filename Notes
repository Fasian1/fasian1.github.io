I like dis font: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P

Open the index.html with a browser while live editing dont friggin push to master every time it takes a while for cache to reload the page so you wont even see changes for forever. 

index.html has all the code
index.css has all the cool style shit. Make functions and stuff here do the putting together in the html. 

images go in images.
